        <v-card-subtitle><b>Biography</b></v-card-subtitle>
        <v-card-text>Three dead fingers is a young metal band from Sweden, consisting of the singer and guitarist Oliwer Bergman, guitarists Remy Fiskis Strandberg and Henrik Backlund, bass player Gustav Jakobsson and drummer Anton Melin. The band was formed in 2015 by Oliwer Bergman and Gustav Jakobsson, who were only 12-13 years old at the time. They have already played big shows and festivals such as Sweden Rock Festival, Skogsröjet and Putte i Parken. 

<br><br>In 2019 they recorded their debut album 'Breed of the Devil', produced by Andreas Fluff Morén and later released on Bleeding Music Records. The good response on their debut album gave them the opportunity to tour in Europe, in both Poland and Austria, before the outbreak of covid-19.

<br><br>The band recently recorded their second full length album together with Micke Gottberg. It will hopefully be released in the near future. </v-card-text>
